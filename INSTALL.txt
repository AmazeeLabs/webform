Requirements
------------

Drupal 4.7


Installation
------------
1. Copy the entire webform directory the Drupal modules directory.

2. Login as an administrator. Enable the module in the "administer" -> "modules"

3. (Optional) Edit the settings under "administer" -> "settings" -> "webform"

Upgrading from previous version
-------------------------------

1. Copy the entire webform directory the Drupal modules directory.

2. Login as the FIRST user or change the $access_check in upgrade.php to FALSE

3. Run upgrade.php (at http://www.yourdrupalsite/upgrade.php)

The .POT file
-------------
The .POT file is a template file for translating the module into non-english languages.
If you are not interested in helping with translation you can safely remove this file 
(and the po directory).

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you are familiar with 4.6 Drupal installations, you are probably familiar with
loading SQL files such as the included webform.mysql file. In Drupal 4.7,
this step has been replaced by use of the update.php file. If you receive SQL
errors during the update (remember to backup!) you may choose to delete all the
webform tables and run webform.mysql to start with a fresh copy of the tables.
